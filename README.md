This project provides a comprehensive MATLAB-based simulation of the KUKA LWR 7-DOF robotic arm, focusing on both its kinematic and dynamic modeling. The implementation includes Denavit-Hartenberg parameterization, forward and inverse kinematics, Jacobian matrix computation, and full dynamic modeling via Newton-Euler recursive relations. A PD controller was designed for trajectory tracking in Simulink, targeting the first four joints. Simulation results confirm the model's accuracy through comparison of end-effector motion, joint trajectories, and Jacobian derivatives. The work serves as a foundational educational tool for understanding advanced robotic manipulation and control systems.
